# Image Classification Model Training, Testing, and Feature Extraction

## Overview
This project mainly covers three core functionalities:
- Training an image classification model with 10-fold cross-validation.
- Evaluating the model on validation and test sets.
- Extracting features from whole slide images (WSIs) and generating heatmaps.

## Scripts

### 1. Training Script (`train.py`)
#### Functionality
- Trains an image classification model using 10-fold cross-validation.
- Evaluates performance on the final validation set.

#### Parameters
- `output_dir`: Directory to save output results.
- `num_classes`: Number of classes.
- `batch_size`: Batch size for training and validation.
- `num_epochs`: Number of epochs for training.
- `lr`: Learning rate.

#### Usage
```bash
python train.py
```

---

### 2. Testing Script (`test.py`)
#### Functionality
- Loads a trained model and evaluates it on the test dataset.
- Saves the test evaluation results.

#### Parameters
- `output_dir`: Directory to save output results.
- `model_path`: Path to the saved trained model.
- `data_path`: Path to the test dataset.
- `num_classes`: Number of classes.
- `batch_size`: Batch size for testing.

#### Usage
```bash
python test.py
```

---

### 3. Feature Extraction Script (`feature_extractor.py`)
#### Functionality
- Extracts features from WSIs.
- Generates heatmaps for visualization.

#### Parameters
- `WSI_FOLDER`: Path to the folder containing WSIs.
- `weights_path`: Path to the pretrained model weights.
- `PATCH_SIZE`: Size of image patches to be extracted.
- `LEVEL`: Magnification level to extract patches from.
- `STRIDE`: Sliding window stride for patch extraction.
- `MODEL_TYPE`: Type of model used for feature extraction.
- `feature_num`: Number of features to extract per patch.

#### Usage
```bash
python feature_extractor.py
```

## Output Files

- **Training Results**:  
  Saved as `unipath_training_results_cv.csv`, containing training metrics like loss, accuracy, and AUC across cross-validation folds.

- **Testing Results**:  
  Saved as `unipath_test_results.csv`, including metrics such as accuracy, AUC, sensitivity, and specificity on the test set.

- **Feature Extraction Results**:  
  - Summary features for each WSI saved as `wsi_feature_summary.csv`.
  - Heatmap images saved as `{slide_name}_heatmap.jpg`.
